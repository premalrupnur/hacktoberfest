# Made With ML is open for community collaborations :tada:

## What are we looking for? :eyes:

We are looking for **interesting colab notebooks(Jupyter notebooks) or scripts covering:** 

- ML/DL techniques ranging from beginner to advance level. [An example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1rXV31gdyqEiXCtmSgff-H-VRuOSzv7IH?usp=sharing).
- Ablation studies. [An example](https://github.com/ayulockin/DataAugmentationTF).
- Model benchmarking on lesser known datasets. 

We are not looking for ML/DL tasks which are commonly known and applied on widely known datasets. An example would be image classification on MNIST/Cifar-10 dataset. However, we would appreciate image classification on lesser known(interesting) dataset.

## How can you contribute? :relaxed:

If you are working on an exciting ML/DL project, we would love to feature your work in this repo. The rules are simple:

1. Create a new issue with a relevant title. Briefly describe the project you are working on in a meaningful manner. Provide links wherever necessary.
2. We will review the issue and approve the idea if it meets the criteria we are looking for. 
3. Fork this repo.
4. Create a PR with notebook(s)/script(s).

We will have some starter issues for you. For more ideas check out [topics page on made with ML](https://madewithml.com/topics/).
